This is a joint project with Servet Ulas and Xin Tong. I am responsible for the game design and coding for the game mechanism.

The game was the finalist of the Student Game Competition in CHI 2016. And it was reported by [SFU news](https://www.sfu.ca/sfunews/stories/2016/sfu-student-game-fosters-empathy-for-chronic-pain-sufferers.html).
